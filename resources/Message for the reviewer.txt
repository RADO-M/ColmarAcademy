Hi , guys ! 
I did some changes to the project by myself , which I think
will not affect the final "red line sheet" .
Most of the requirements are done in order , just some measurements in 
some of the elements were changed as well as a little shadow effect 
on the nav bar .
I hope you are going to enjoy the slightly different vision of the page
at all.

Regards : Rado.
